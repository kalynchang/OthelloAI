Week 9
We met up before the Sunday extra credit deadline and learned how to use bitbucket. Then on Sunday night we met up again to implement a working AI that played random moves. It worked. We started discussing how we could implement a heuristic function. On Monday night we met up to add a heuristic function so that our AI beat SimplePlayer consistently. We managed to beat SimplePlayer 9/10 times. We pushed our changes and turned in our assignment because we weren't able to figure out how to implement the minimax decision tree on time. We did all of the work together at the same time.
